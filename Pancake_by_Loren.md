**Loren’s fluffy pancakes**

##### By: Loren

1 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
Half teaspoon baking soda
Half teaspoon salt


Stir


In a separate bowl:
3/4 cup milk
Half cup plain yogurt
1 egg
2 tablespoons oil


Stir


Add dry mixture to wet mixture and gently stir until dry mixture is just incorporated. Don’t over-mix.

Pour about a quarter of a cup onto a hot frying pan (I prefer non-stick so no oil is needed for frying), flip when bubbles start popping on the surface. Cook until lightly browned.
