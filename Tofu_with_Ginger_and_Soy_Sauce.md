**Tofu with Ginger and Soy Sauce**

##### By: Eric

Take one block of medium-firm tofu and slice it into even pieces. Grate some fresh ginger on top, then add as much soy sauce as you like. That’s it — super easy, healthy, fast, and delicious! You could enjoy it together with rice.

I do this all the time too! I like to add sliced spring onions and bonito flakes on top. Sometimes, I use ponzu (citrus flavoured soy sauce) to replace soy sauce. :)
